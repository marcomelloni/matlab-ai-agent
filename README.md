> Transform your MATLAB workflow with AI-powered automation

A Python-based toolkit that leverages AI to **generate**, **validate**, and **execute** MATLAB simulations. Seamlessly bridge modern LLM-driven workflows (GPT-4) with traditional MATLAB scientific computing.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß† **AI-Powered Code Generation**  
   Generate clean, production-ready MATLAB scripts with GPT-4 via natural language prompts.
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Code Validation**  
   Catch warnings & errors with MATLAB's `mlint` (`checkcode`) and display line-by-line feedback.
- üöÄ **Real-Time Simulation**  
   Stream and capture simulation outputs, plots, and figures via MATLAB Engine & TCP/IP.
- üîÑ **Error Correction Loop**  
   Auto-fix common syntax & runtime errors by feeding MATLAB error messages back to the LLM.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive CLI**  
   Engage in an AI-guided REPL to iteratively refine, validate, and run your MATLAB code.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (In Seconds!)

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/marcomelloni/matlab-ai-agent
cd matlab-ai

# 2. Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# 3. Set your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# 4. Launch and start creating!
poetry run matlab-ai-agent interactive
```

That's it! Start transforming your ideas into working MATLAB code instantly.

## üîß Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **MATLAB R2024a or later** (with MATLAB Engine for Python installed)
- **OpenAI API Key** (for GPT-4 integration)
- **Poetry** (‚â•1.5.0) for environment & dependency management

## üì¶ Detailed Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Working Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcomelloni/matlab-ai-agent
cd matlab-ai
```

#### 2. Install Poetry and Create Virtual Environment

Ensure Poetry is installed on your system. If not already installed, execute the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry env activate
```

> **Important:**  
> The command `poetry env activate` provides the activation command which must be executed separately.  
> Copy and run the displayed command, for example:

```bash
source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Verify environment activation:

```bash
which python
```

#### 3. Install Project Dependencies

Install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
poetry install
```

#### 4. Install the MATLAB Engine API for Python

To integrate MATLAB with Python, install the MATLAB Engine API within your Poetry environment using one of these methods:

#### 4.1 Installation Using In-built Python Package

Using the package included with your MATLAB installation (example for MATLAB R2024b on MacOS):

```bash
cd /Applications/MATLAB_R2024b.app/extern/engines/python
poetry run python -m pip install .
```

> **Note:** Adjust the path according to your MATLAB version and installation location.

#### 4.2 Install via pip

Alternatively, use the version-specific [matlabengine](https://pypi.org/project/matlabengine) pip package:

```bash
pip install matlabengine==24.2.2
```

Select the version compatible with your MATLAB release from the [package history](https://pypi.org/project/matlabengine/#history).

#### 5. Verify the MATLAB Engine Installation

Confirm successful installation with:

```bash
poetry run python -c "import matlab.engine; print('MATLAB Engine is installed successfully')"
```

Expected output:

```
MATLAB Engine is installed successfully!
```

#### 6. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Interactive Mode

Launch an AI-guided interactive session for generating, validating, and executing MATLAB code:

```bash
poetry run matlab-ai-agent interactive
```

Options:

- `--matlab / --no-matlab`: Enable/disable MATLAB engine for validation and execution (enabled by default)

Interactive capabilities:

- Generate MATLAB code from natural language descriptions
- Validate code with mlint and automatically correct errors
- Execute simulations and diagnose issues
- Refine code through additional prompts
- Save generated code to .m files
- Exit with option to close the MATLAB engine

### Execution Mode

Execute existing MATLAB files:

```bash
poetry run matlab-ai-agent execute path/to/file.m
```

Parameters:

- `<filepath>`: Path to the .m file to execute

The file is executed via the MATLAB engine, with output and simulation results displayed upon successful execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Package Development

The developer-specific commands are:

```bash
# Run test suite
poetry run pytest

# Run linting checks
poetry run pylint src

# Format code automatically
poetry run autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --recursive .
```
